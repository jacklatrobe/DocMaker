## Project Name: AI Document Generator

This project aims to leverage the power of AI, specifically GPT-4, to create a solution for generating structured documents such as tenders, proposals, or status reports. The target market is consultancies and agencies looking to speed up and standardize their response process. The tool is designed to guide users through the bid process while also leveraging AI for document generation.

## Technologies

The project will be built using Python, with the LangChain library for language model integration, and Flask for hosting a JavaScript front-end.

### Python

Python is a high-level, interpreted, and general-purpose dynamic programming language that focuses on code readability. The syntax in Python helps the programmers to do coding in fewer steps as compared to Java or C++.

For more information, visit the [Python Official Website](https://www.python.org/).

### LangChain

LangChain is a Python library that provides a framework for developing applications powered by language models. It allows developers to build applications that not only call out to a language model but also connect a language model to other sources of data and allow a language model to interact with its environment.

For more information, visit the [LangChain PyPI page](https://pypi.org/project/langchain/) and the [LangChain Documentation](https://python.langchain.com/en/latest/index.html).

### Flask

Flask is a web framework for Python, which provides tools, libraries, and technologies that allow you to build a web application. This web application can be some web pages, a blog, a wiki, or go as big as a web-based calendar application or a commercial website.

For more information, visit the [Flask Official Website](https://flask.palletsprojects.com/).

## Project Structure

The project will be structured as follows:

- `docs/`: This folder will contain all the documentation related to the project.
- `src/`: This folder will contain the source code of the project.
- `tests/`: This folder will contain all the test cases and testing scripts.
- `infra/`: This folder will contain all the infrastructure-related code and configuration files.
- `README.md`: This file provides an overview of the project.

## Getting Started

To get started with the project, you need to install LangChain. You can install it using pip:

```bash
pip install langchain
```
